Before run docker-compose up -d, need to create user and group

!!!! ATTENTION !!!!
Create new dev user on Centos or Ubuntu server
www group guid - 1111
dev user uid - 1111
!!!!!
DEV must be primary member of www group!

Basic usage:
clone repo with docker
init submodule (WIP)
deploy site from submodule
run - docker-compose up -d

docker images used in docker-compose
mysql:5.6.34 - official mysql image based on (forgot)
adminer:latest - docker hub image based on alpine
web - our custom httpd build based on Centos 6 
nginx - official nginx image based in debian (I think)
